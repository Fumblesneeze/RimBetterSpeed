  <description>Tweaks speed settings globally and adds a new carry weight penalty mechanic:

- Pawns will walk slower the more they carry
- Pawns generally walk faster
- Pawns generally shoot faster
- Doors generally open faster

All the settings are customizable in the game using the mod settings.

Requires HugsLib to be installed and loaded previously.

Made using Harmony.
