  <description>Tweaks speed settings globally and adds a new carry weight penalty mechanic:

- Pawns generally walk faster
- Pawns generally shoot faster
- Doors generally open faster
- Carrying stuff will slow pawns down

Update 1:
- A17 update
- Animals will have half of the carry penalty applied to them at all times

All the settings are customizable in the game using the mod settings.

Requires HugsLib to be installed and loaded previously.

Made using Harmony.
